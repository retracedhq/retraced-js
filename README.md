This is the official NodeJS client for interacting with the Retraced API. Retraced is an "audit logs as a service" provider, allowing developers to easily implement audit logging in their multi-tenant products and services. For more information, see the official website: https://www.retraced.io/

## Installation
### yarn
```shell
$ yarn add retraced
```

### npm
```shell
$ npm i -s retraced
```

## Usage
```typescript
import * as Retraced from "retraced";

// Initialize the client with your information.
const retraced = new Retraced.Client({
	apiKey: "your api key goes here",
	projectId: "your project id goes here",
});

// Report some audit events!
async function createNewRecord(request) {
	const newRecord = /* transform request into newRecord */
	// ... some more business logic here ...

	// Now construct the audit event to be reported to Retraced.
	const event = {
		action: "some.record.created",
		group: {
      id: "12345",
      name: "My Rad Customer",
    }
		crud: "c",
		sourceIp: request.ip,
		actor: {
			id: "ultra.employee@customertowne.xyz",
			displayName: "Ultra Employee",
			url: "https://customertowne.xyz/employees/123456",
		},
		target: {
			id: newRecord.id,
			displayName: newRecord.name,
			url: "https://customertowne.xyz/records/" + newRecord.id,
		},
	};

	// The Retraced client's methods are asynchronous.
	// You can "fire and forget" them...
	retraced.reportEvent(event);

	// ... "await" them...
	console.log("Reporting...");
	await retraced.reportEvent(event);
	console.log("Finished reporting!");

	// ... or treat them as Promises.
	console.log("Reporting...");
	retraced.reportEvent(event)
	  .then(() => { console.log("Finished reporting!"); })
	  .catch((err) => handleError(err));
}
```
